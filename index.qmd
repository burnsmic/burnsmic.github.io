# **Welcome!**

My research takes a multidisciplinary approach to understand the evolutionary processes that gave rise to the exceptional diversity of fishes. Specifically, I am interested in understanding how morphological diversity arises at large geographic scales and over deep evolutionary time. I do this by reconstructing phenotypic evolution across global radiations that encompass hundreds to thousands of fish species. Using a big data approach, I combine phylogenomics, quantitative comparative anatomy, and phylogenetic comparative methods to compare hundreds of replicated evolutionary events across independent lineages and diverse geographies.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at University of California, Davis in the [Wainwright Lab](https://fishlab.ucdavis.edu/).

## Research Journey

:::{layout="[65,35]"}

:::{#research-journey}

I received my BS in Zoology from Southern Illinois University, where I was lucky enough to work with Dr. Brooks Burr on taxonomy of freshwater darters and jumped into the world of ichthyology.

From there I completed my Master's at the University of Hawaiʻi, Mānoa, under the advisement of Dr. Kassi Cole. Aside from learning to surf and honing my beach volleyball skills, I conducted research on the evolution of reproductive morphology and hermaphrodism in Indo-Pacific gobies.

I completed my PhD in the Sidlauskas Lab at Oregon State University in Spring 2018. My dissertation research addressed the tempo and mode of diversification in African and South American characiforms. I combined molecular phylogenomics, comparative morphology, and phylogenetic comparative methods to better understand the evolutionary processes that gave rise to biodiversity.

I built on my PhD research as an Edward W. Rose Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/) and [Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates](https://www.cumv.cornell.edu/) and I am now a [Postdoctoral Researcher](https://fishlab.ucdavis.edu/lab-members-fixed/#Michael%20Burns) in the [Wainwright Lab](https://fishlab.ucdavis.edu/) at the University of California, Davis where I have returned to saltwater and coral reef fishes.
