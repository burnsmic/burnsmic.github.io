    "text": "Curatorial Philosophy\nCollections, and the data that they contain, are the central component of my teaching and research program. My curatorial philosophy centers around four focus areas to promote diverse museums with broad appeals to scientists, educators, and the public: growth, access, outreach, and education.\n\nGrowth\nPassive collection growth involves developing and maintaining partnerships with local, state, and federal agencies that regularly perform biodiversity assessments to generate regular yearly growth. Active collection growth involves developing an active field component that incorporates research expeditions both domestically and globally.\n\n\nAccess\nNatural history specimens are most useful when the data are freely and easily accessible to all. During my time at the CUMV, I participated in the NSF funded oVert and Scan All Fishes initiatives, whose goals are to provide free, digital 3D vertebrate anatomy models and data to researchers, educators, students, and the public. During my time at the CUMV, I helped digitize and curate ~1000 specimens of African fishes, all of which are freely available on the digital repository morphosource. These included many rare specimens, some of which are only housed at the CUMV, increasing the reach and accessibility of specimens at the museum.\n\n\nOutreach\nMuseums are treasure troves of biodiversity data that can transport a person from rural Oregon to a coral reef in Australia, to the heart of the Amazon Rainforest, all in a single afternoon. Modern technology, including digital specimen collections, facilitate creative and flexible outreach tools that extend the reach of fluid-based collections beyond the traditional museum setting—reaching a more diverse and broad audience.\n\n\nEducation\nOne of my greatest passions as a scientist is pulling data out of museum drawers and into the classroom. Museum specimens provide a valuable resource when teaching systematics and evolutionary biology. I have co-developed two courses that utilized museum specimens to actively engage students in the classroom, including an online-course that was made possible through an extensive digitial speciman collection and course database, as well as a hands-on research based course."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The fish order Characiformes, with over 2000 described species, is one of the largest and most diverse freshwater lineages on the planet. The order exhibits an unparalleled amount of diversity in morphology and ecology, but little is known about the processes that have formed such a large radiation. My dissertation research is focused on understanding the evolutionary processes that gave rise to body shape and species diversity in the order. Below are details for each of my dissertation chapters.\nBody shape diversification and convergence in response to trophic ecology in the order Characiformes Morphological convergence plays a central role in the study of evolution. Convergence is typically caused by shared ecological specialization and hints at the underlying selective pressures and adaptive constraints that shape morphological diversification in organisms. Different trophic ecologies, including piscivory, herbivory, insectivory, and detritivory, evolved multiple times in the fish order Characiformes. I examined body shape morphology in 230 species of characiform fishes, combined with a phylogenetic tree, compared the body shape optimum across different trophic ecologies.\nEvolutionary modularity and rates of morphological diversification\nEvolutionary modularity allows for different morphological regions to respond independently to selective pressures. Morphological diversity can increase with modularity because the modules can respond independently to different selective regimes, allowing for rapid adaptation to a suite of ecological pressures. I seek to analyze body shape diversification in the order to determine if evolutionary modularity and differential selection across different trophic ecologies shaped morphological evolution.\nLineage diversification and correlated evolution\nMany evolutionary processes predict that rates of morphological evolution should be positively associated with rates of speciation. I am examining body shape evolution in 230 species of characiform fishes to test the hypothesis that body shape evolution is positively correlated with species formation."

I am currently working with an undergraduate student, Justin Hansen (see my mentoring section for more info on how awesome Justin is!), to analyze the axial skeleton of piscivorous species and their sister taxa. Justin is using several linear measurements to determine exactly what regions of the body are elongating for piscivorous lineages to converge in overall body shape.\nWe are in the process of writing up the results and hope to submit the manuscript this summer!"

    "text": "Coral reef fishes exhibit both dramatic trophic diversity and exceptional body shape diversity. In an effort to better understand the role of trade-offs and complexity as drivers of ecomorphological diversity, we looked at diversification of the feeding mechanism in coral reef fishes. We show that the primary axis of variation in musculo-skeletal traits is aligned with a trade-off between mobility and force transmission, spanning species that capture prey with suction and those that bite attached prey. We found weak or no covariation among about half the traits, facilitating deviations from the trade-off axis. The dramatic trophic diversity found among reef fishes is characterized by a major trade-off between jaws built for biting vs. mobility, with numerous departures along the biting-mobility axis that use diverse trait combinations to adapt the feeding mechanism to diverse challenges.\n\n\n\nMorphospace of known suction feeding species compared to know biting species"

Previous research has shown that availability of diverse aquatic habitats has in part driven this extreme diversity (Burns et al. 2024).\nWe have an ongoing research project where we are looking more closely at how body shape differs across flow habitats and exploring the role of time, evolutionary rate, and morphological constraints in explaining the observed patterns of unequal diversity. Our study highlights how dramatic differences in morphological disparity in hyperdiverse radiations can evolve under relatively muted evolutionary dynamics.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Superfamily Anostomoidea is a hyperdiverse clade of approximately 270 fish species divided unevenly into four families . The two most speciose, Anostomidae and Curimatidae, differ greatly in ecomorphological diversity. The anostomid species eat a variety of foods including plants, algae, macroinvertebrates, sponges and small fishes and exhibit lots of morphological diversity. While the curimatids are strictly detritivorous fishes with a limited morphological diversity. Members of Prochilodontidae share the detritivorous habits of the curimatids and vary little in morphology and chilodontids feed mostly on detritus and invertebrates.\nThe variation in species numbers and ecomorphological diversity make the Anostomoidea an ideal group to test different macroevolutionary hypotheses. However, a time calibrated molecular phylogeny does not exist for the group. Members of the Sidlauskas Lab and numerous collaborators are in the process of generating two different molecular trees for the group: a traditional six gene Sanger sequenced tree and next gene phylogenomic tree using Ultraconserved Elements (UCE’s). We are hoping to get the two different manuscripts out this summer!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Many marine fish lineages show sister species or sister clade relationships between subtidal and intertidal habitat. However, subtidal and intertidal habitat differ greatly in their selective pressures. Fishes in intertidal habitat are intermittently submerged and thus experience large fluctuations in flow, temperature, and oxygen, while subtidal habitat is relatively static with little fluctuation in flow, temperature, or oxygenation. The ecological divergence between sister clades of fishes creates the perfect opportunity to test theories of adaptive evolution and ecological speciation, including the generality of morphological divergence between these two ecoregions.\nTo understand this phenomenon, we conducted a macroevolutionary analysis examining the morphological divergence between intertidal and subtidal lineages in the sculpin tribe Oligocottinae. We found that the ancestral habitat for oligocottin sculpins was intertidal, with species independently invading the subtidal habitat six times from an intertidal ancestor. Furthermore, subtidal lineages exhibit a more streamlined, elongated shape than their intertidal sister groups, while intertidal species exhibited a wide range of body shapes.\nBuser, T.J., M.D. Burns, J.
